# Changelog

Calver headings match the 88plug hub (`YEAR.MONTH.<commit-count>` on `main`).

## Unreleased

- **Fitted screenshots advertised the WRONG view transform — every capped-client click
  missed by the shrink ratio.** `encode_store` stamped `SESSION["view"]` (scale/dw/dh) and
  the response text BEFORE `fit_to_budget` re-encoded the image smaller, so the client
  received a 526x296 image while both the text and the transform claimed 2576x1449 at
  scale 0.6708. A model clicking what it saw had its coords divided by the pre-shrink
  scale — landing ~4.9x short — and `view_id` could not catch it because the id never
  changed. This is the exact "I clicked where I saw it but it missed" class the view_id
  machinery exists to prevent, introduced by the cap-fitting work itself. `fit_to_budget`
  now returns the size it actually encoded and `encode_store` restates the transform from
  it. Verified live: a click at the shipped image's centre now maps to (1920, 1083) of a
  3840x2160 desktop. Found by the max code review; two finders reached it independently.
- **`screen_reload` silently lost a client-derived output cap.** The cap is learned from
  the `initialize` handshake, but `os.execv` keeps only the environment and the client does
  not re-send `initialize` over the preserved stdio connection — so after any reload a Grok
  session fell back to uncapped and its next screenshot was dropped again. The resolved cap
  is now pinned into `MCP_SCREEN_MAX_OUTPUT_KB` before the exec.
- **The envelope reserve is no longer a fixed 2 KB.** `fit_to_budget` takes `reserve_bytes`
  (floored at 512) and `encode_store` passes what it will actually emit, including the
  stale-risk note. An `annotate=true` response carries a line per detected element, which
  on a busy 4K desktop far exceeds 2 KB and would push the combined result back over the cap.
- **`scripts/run-python.sh`: the no-Python diagnostic was unreachable.** Under
  `set -euo pipefail` the retry assignment inside `|| { ... }` aborts the script on its own
  failure, so a box with no usable Python got a bare non-zero exit instead of the install
  hint. Reproduced standalone, fixed with `|| true` + an `if !` guard.
- **`scripts/run-python.sh`: an existing venv without `--system-site-packages` was adopted.**
  `[ -d "$VENV" ]` short-circuited creation, so a tree left by an interrupted run got the
  stamp written and permanently locked the server onto an interpreter that cannot import
  `gi`. It is now probed for `gi` and rebuilt when it fails.
- **`requirements.txt` named an OCR package the code cannot import.** It listed
  `rapidocr-onnxruntime>=1.4` labelled "(RapidOCR v3)", but `grounding.py` does
  `from rapidocr import RapidOCR` and that distribution ships `rapidocr_onnxruntime`
  instead — verified in a clean container: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
  'rapidocr'`. Anyone installing from requirements.txt therefore got a server with OCR
  silently disabled (the import is try/except-guarded, so it degraded quietly). Now
  `rapidocr>=3.0`, matching the import and requirements-runtime.txt.
- **CI moved 3.12 -> 3.13.** The pin existed solely because `rapidocr-onnxruntime`
  declares `requires_python <3.13`; the package we actually use, `rapidocr` v3, declares
  `<4,>=3.8`. Verified on PyPI and by installing the CI dep set plus rapidocr on 3.13 in a
  container. Stale references removed from README and docs/install.md too.
- **Output-budget fitting moved to `budget.py` so CI actually executes it.** The logic sat
  in `capture.py`, which cannot be imported without a real gi/GStreamer/D-Bus session — a
  headless run substitutes a stub `capture`, so the tests raised `AttributeError` and CI was
  red on every commit from `ce7534d` to `3736ab4` while passing locally. `budget.py` imports
  only stdlib + Pillow and takes the downscaler INJECTED, the same discipline
  `reliability.py` already uses for its grabber. `budget.MAX_OUT_KB` is now the single source
  of truth (capture reads it, `server._apply_client_limits` writes it) instead of two copies
  that could drift. 11 budget tests now run headless (156 passed / 28 skipped, up from
  146 / 33) and are mutation-checked: shortening the fit loop fails them.
- **OCR grounding is 2.1x faster and burns 3.8x less CPU — `screen_read_text` on an
  uncached 4K monitor went 85 s → 40.6 s.** Profiling the stages (not guessing) put 98.3%
  of the cost in OCR (ocr 56327 ms vs omni 721 ms, cv 221 ms), and splitting OCR put it in
  recognition, not detection (det 3482 ms, det+rec 56072 ms). Two plausible fixes were
  measured and both were WRONG: more threads / bigger rec batch made it worse
  (50.7 s → 69.4 s → 84.1 s), and downscaling the frame saved 12% while losing 54% of the
  text. The real signal was 55 s wall against **610 s of process CPU** — onnxruntime's
  default `intra_op_num_threads=-1` spawns a thread per core and they spin-wait instead of
  progressing. Fewer threads is faster: 24→55.5 s/610 s, 4→32.2 s/137 s, **6→25.9 s/161 s**
  (knee), 8→26.9 s/210 s, 12→33.7 s/334 s. `_omni_session` already capped at 6; `ocr_boxes`
  never got the same treatment, so both ONNX consumers now share one `_CPU_THREADS`
  (`MCP_SCREEN_CPU_THREADS`). The 610 s also starved the rest of the desktop, so this is a
  politeness fix as much as a speed one. Regression test is mutation-checked.
- **Screenshots are no longer DROPPED on clients that cap tool output.** Grok Build
  truncates an MCP tool result at 20 KB; our ~900 KB of base64 was cut mid-string, failed
  its image integrity check ("image bytes are truncated"), and the image was discarded
  entirely — screen-mcp was effectively blind under Grok, while the tool call still looked
  successful. `encode_store` now fits the payload to the cap, sized analytically (encoded
  size tracks pixel count, so one lossy probe predicts the scale) with a halving fallback
  so fitting is guaranteed. The cap comes from the `initialize` handshake's `clientInfo`,
  so nothing needs configuring; Claude stays uncapped on a byte-identical no-op path.
  A real 4K shot lands ~15 KB and stays legible; region shots (~3 KB) were never affected.
- **`region` + `monitor` together no longer silently drops the region.** `capture_desktop`
  returned early on `monitor is not None`, before the `region` branch, so asking for
  `region=[0,0,600,300] monitor=0` handed back the whole 3840x2160 monitor with no error —
  a plausible-but-wrong result. They now mean "this box, relative to that monitor's origin";
  `region` alone stays desktop-absolute. Both contracts pinned by tests.
- **A fresh clone now provisions its whole runtime itself.** `pyproject.toml` declared no
  dependencies and the launcher looked for a `.venv` nothing ever created, so users hit a
  server that would not import. `scripts/run-python.sh` now provisions the full runtime set
  by default (a server that starts with no OCR reads as broken, not as a missing extra).
  Six failures found by running it in a clean container, none visible on a working desktop:
  `evdev` has no wheel and its failure sank the entire install (now separate, best-effort,
  prefers `evdev-binary`); the first interpreter on PATH usually lacks `gi` (selection now
  prefers a gi-capable one); Debian ships `venv` separately (falls back to
  `pip install --target` + PYTHONPATH); that interpreter often has no pip or ensurepip
  (pip's `--python` lets any pip-capable python populate the target with the right ABI);
  a FAILED venv leaves a partial tree that hid `gi` and won selection (removed on failure,
  and a venv is only adopted if it kept `gi`); and `rapidocr` pulls non-headless opencv so
  `cv2` died on `libGL` (headless force-reinstalled last). Satisfaction checks use
  `find_spec` rather than importing — importing onnxruntime per start cost ~3 s (3.4 s →
  0.65 s). Measured: **musl is not viable** — onnxruntime publishes no musl wheel, so an
  Alpine build silently loses OmniParser grounding; glibc/manylinux stays. PyGObject,
  GStreamer and PipeWire remain the one layer that cannot ship with us (no wheel; they bind
  the host typelibs and running compositor), so the launcher now prints the exact
  pacman/apt/dnf command instead of a generic error.

- **WebP lossless encode is ~19x cheaper — a plain screenshot went 4194 ms → 1286 ms.**
  Encoding was 85% of a shot's wall time (3564 ms of it), measured on a real 2576x1449
  frame. libwebp's `method`/`quality` only trade CPU for bytes in lossless mode — the
  pixels are identical at every setting — so `method=0, quality=20` is a free win:
  195 ms for 140 KB more. Those bytes cost nothing, because an image is billed at
  `ceil(w/28) * ceil(h/28)` visual tokens (4784 here) regardless of encoded size, and
  759 KB of base64 is far under the API's 10 MB per-image cap. Env-overridable via
  `MCP_SCREEN_WEBP_METHOD` / `MCP_SCREEN_WEBP_EFFORT`; `tests/test_encode.py` asserts
  pixel-exact round-trips at every method/effort combination so the lossless guarantee
  cannot silently regress.

- **Adversarial-args probe: three defects, one root cause, fixed at the source.**
  A read-only sweep of hostile inputs found that `capture_desktop` validated nothing:
  `monitor=99` leaked a raw `list index out of range`, an entirely off-screen region
  returned a crop that `screen_read_text` reported as `count:0` (indistinguishable from
  "the region exists and is empty"), and — worst — `screen_verify` graded that same
  nonexistent region **CONFIRMED / changed:true**, certifying an action against pixels
  that do not exist. Fixed once in a pure `capture.validate_scope()` so all three tools
  inherit it, with the error naming the valid range. Mutation-checked: disabling the
  off-screen guard fails the suite.

- **`screen_do` failed on the first call after a reload.** It deliberately bypasses
  `_action`, which is what normally primes monitor geometry, so `SESSION["geo"]` was still
  None and the first pointer step died with a bare `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not
  iterable`. Same shape as the documented focus-after-reload bug. `tool_do` now primes geo
  once, and `global_to_logical` raises an actionable error instead of a TypeError. Found by
  a cold-start probe — earlier `screen_do` calls only worked because a screenshot had
  already primed geo.

- **`_maybe_shot` waits for the frame to change instead of sleeping a flat 350ms.**
  `settle` is now a CEILING, not a cost. The blind sleep was wrong in both directions —
  it charged every fast action the full delay and still grabbed a pre-change frame when the
  UI was slower. This is also the only place `MCP_SCREEN_WAIT_MODE=hybrid` can matter for
  an agent: the change-gate in `tool_screenshot` requires a screenshot within 1.5s of an
  action, which separate tool calls from a model never are. Third instance of the same
  defect class this session (see also the clipboard wait).

- **Cross-layer verification proven end-to-end with os-control-mcp's `os_verify`.**
  `screen_verify`'s `pixel` block is exactly the contract `os_verify` consumes, so the two
  compose with no code changes — confirmed by running both quadrants against the live
  desktop: a GUI-only action (hover) with an untouched unit returns `DIVERGED` /
  `cross_layer: "pixel-changed-os-static"` / `reconciled: false`, and an action inert at
  both layers returns `NO_OP` / `reconciled: true`. The integration gap was documentation,
  not plumbing: os-control's `cross-layer-verify` skill predated `screen_verify` and taught
  only the passive `screen_sense`. It now teaches both and says when each applies —
  `screen_verify` polls and grades (use when the GUI effect may lag), `screen_sense` reads
  what the last action already left behind (use when it is instantaneous).

- **New `screen_verify` — grade the last action instead of eyeballing a screenshot.**
  Returns CONFIRMED | PARTIAL | NO_OP | DIVERGED, the same vocabulary as os-control-mcp's
  `os_verify`, and the `pixel` block it returns is exactly what `os_verify` consumes — so
  the GUI and OS verdicts compose. NO_OP is the one worth having: the screen never changed,
  so the click missed or the keys went to the wrong window — the failure a screenshot makes
  you infer by eye. (Steal from QuickDesk's `verify_action_result`.)

  Its first eval found a false-CONFIRMED: the baseline is a hash of the whole stamped node
  frame, and hashing a REGION crop against it compares different images, so it always
  differed and every action graded as changed — including a mouse move, which cannot change
  the screen at all (the cursor is METADATA, never baked into frames). The change check now
  re-grabs the same node; with no baseline node, `changed` is reported null and excluded
  from the verdict rather than invented. Same false-CONFIRMED class os-control had just
  fixed in `os_verify`. Post-fix: inert mouse move → NO_OP, hover highlight → CONFIRMED in
  23ms.

  `wait_text` and `verify` now share one `_perceive()` (recall → OCR → learn), so neither
  can drift back into reading the world-model cache without writing it.

- **New `screen_wait_text` — block until text appears, then return its click coords.**
  Replaces screenshotting in a loop to see whether something finished. Naive polling was a
  non-starter (grounding costs ~7.7s on a cold screen), so it uses the shape this session
  measured: a grab is ~35ms while OCR is the expensive part, so it polls the frame HASH and
  only pays for perception when pixels actually changed — measured 11 grabs / 1 OCR pass
  over a 10s wait on a static screen. It also recalls from **and writes to** the world model,
  so a repeat wait on a learned screen skips OCR entirely: **8574ms → 41ms (209x)**.
  (Steal from QuickDesk's `wait_for_text`.)

- **OCR matching is whitespace-tolerant in `screen_wait_text` and `screen_read_text`.**
  Found by the first eval of wait_text, which timed out on a button that was plainly on
  screen: OCR renders it `Launch installer` or `Launchinstaller` depending on the run, so a
  literal substring test misses it. Both tools now compare raw and whitespace-stripped.

- **New `screen_read_text` — read the screen as text + click coords, no image.** Every
  latency win this session left the token cost untouched: an image bills a FIXED
  `ceil(w/28)*ceil(h/28)` visual tokens (4784 for a 4K monitor) regardless of how small the
  encode gets. For navigate-by-text work the pixels are not what the caller needs. Measured
  on a 4K monitor: 4784 tokens / 412ms for a screenshot vs **~1350 tokens / 67ms** unfiltered
  (104 elements) and **~95 tokens** with `contains=`. Reuses the existing perception path —
  world-model recall first, which skips OCR entirely on a known screen (7747ms → 42ms
  measured) — so it was almost entirely wiring, not new machinery. Coordinates return in
  desktop space and are directly clickable. (Steal from QuickDesk's `get_ui_state`.)

  The first draft of the tool description claimed "~10x cheaper". Measuring it gave 3.5x
  unfiltered and 50x filtered, so the description now carries the real numbers.

- **`screen_read_selection` waits for the clipboard instead of guessing 140ms.** It slept a
  fixed `GLib.usleep(140000)` after sending the copy combo, then read. That was wrong in both
  directions: it charged every fast app the full delay, and any app slower than it read back
  EMPTY — which, since we clear the clipboard first, is indistinguishable from "nothing was
  copied" and surfaced as a false negative. Now polls at 15ms until non-empty or
  `MCP_SCREEN_SELECTION_TIMEOUT_S` (default 1.5s). Clearing first is what makes polling sound:
  non-empty can only mean this copy landed. Verified live — the terminal under test took
  ~1.3s to publish the selection, i.e. the old fixed sleep would have failed it.
  (Steal from QuickDesk's `wait_for_clipboard_change`.)

- **Encode re-swept and left alone — it is already at the floor (negative result).**
  With the shipped `m=0 q=20` at 202ms median (9 reps) on the current RGB/INTER_AREA output,
  nothing beats it: higher lossless effort is 237-251ms, `method=1` is 344-613ms, PNG is
  343-768ms, and **lossy WebP is SLOWER** (228-307ms) because it runs rate-distortion
  analysis while lossless method=0 is fast entropy coding. So the lossless guarantee costs
  no speed at all — it is not a quality/latency tradeoff, and there is no reason to weaken
  it. Recorded as a DO-NOT-RE-TUNE block in `capture.py` next to the constants.

  Method note: a 3-rep bench made `q=40` look 8% faster and 8% smaller; at 9 reps it is 24%
  SLOWER. Third time this session a small-sample bench pointed the wrong way (see also the
  offline LANCZOS figure and the first filter eval) — medians, repeats, and measuring the
  live path are the only things that have held up.

- **Test harness is REAL-FIRST — the suite now executes capture.py instead of a stub.**
  `tests/conftest.py` unconditionally installed stub `gi`/`state`/`capture` modules into
  `sys.modules`, so 144 passing tests never ran a line of the shipped capture path. Every
  capture bug this session was caught by driving the real desktop instead: an ndarray
  aliasing an unmapped GstBuffer (read-only + use-after-free), a missed `_sample_to_rgba`
  rename, and a handler returning a bare `str` where the dispatcher indexes `["content"]`.
  conftest now probes for real gi + Gst + a session bus and only stubs what genuinely will
  not import, exposing `REAL_STACK` so tests can gate. New `tests/test_capture_real.py`
  covers the real `_sample_to_rgb` (exact pixels, row-padding stride trim, and that the
  result is writable and owns its data), `_downscale` incl. the PIL fallback, and a
  **view-transform round-trip** — the click-accuracy invariant, previously untested.
  150 pass locally against the real stack; 144 pass + 6 skip in CI where gi is absent.

  The new tests were mutation-checked rather than assumed: reintroducing the alias bug fails
  2, adding a broken stride trim fails 3, and forcing the view transform to 1:1 fails 4.

  Re-ran legibility end-to-end through the real `encode_store` (real downscale, real WebP
  settings, real transform) rather than an offline approximation: 92% mean / 91% across the
  three smallest fonts — matching the offline cv2 INTER_AREA figures exactly.

- **Screenshot downscale moved to cv2 INTER_AREA — 15x faster than PIL LANCZOS.**
  287.5ms → 18.8ms on a real 3840x2160 → 2576x1449 frame; live shot 528ms → 412ms with
  the resize stage at 84ms (was 408ms two commits ago). INTER_AREA is also the principled
  filter for minification: it averages the source pixels each output pixel covers, so it
  antialiases without the ringing a cubic/lanczos kernel leaves on text edges. The encoded
  payload got *smaller* too (538KB → 502KB) — less high-frequency ringing to compress.
  Falls back to PIL when cv2 is absent, so capture never hard-depends on grounding's stack.

  This also **reverses an earlier call in this changelog**. A narrower eval had LANCZOS 1pp
  ahead of the alternatives and concluded "don't swap the filter". Re-run against known
  rendered text at 9/10/11/12/13/14/16/20px, PIL-LANCZOS / INTER_AREA / INTER_LANCZOS4 /
  INTER_CUBIC all score 92-93% mean and 91-92% across the three smallest sizes — the gap
  was never real, and 15x was being paid for nothing.

  It also kills a planned GStreamer `videoscale` change. videoscale-lanczos measured 78.5ms
  net, genuinely faster than PIL — but it would have required teaching every coordinate path
  that frame px != desktop px (the documented click-accuracy hazard), and pipeline scaling is
  EAGER: it runs on every damage frame (~3.5/s) rather than only frames we pull. cv2 is
  lazy, 4x faster still, and touches no coordinates.

- **Alpha plane dropped end-to-end — pipeline negotiates RGB, not RGBA.** The stage timer
  showed resize was 68% of a shot (408ms of 601ms), and it was resizing a channel nothing
  reads: the alpha byte was forced to a constant 255, carried through LANCZOS, then encoded.
  videoconvert now emits 24-bit RGB, so the decode copies 24.9MB instead of 33.2MB and the
  resize works on 3 channels — measured 471ms → 298ms (1.58x) on a real frame. Encode is
  ~18ms slower on RGB but the output is byte-for-byte the same size (745KB), because a
  constant alpha plane compresses to nothing. Net ~155ms/shot; live shot 601ms → 528ms with
  resize 408 → 264. Colors verified live after the caps change.

- **Per-stage timing on every screenshot and action (`stages: …ms`).** Stage stamps live in
  `state.py` (the one module everything imports, so no cycle) and cover pull, decode, resize,
  encode, aware, ground, gate and settle, plus an explicit `other` remainder so unexplained
  time is visible rather than hidden. This exists because benching stages OFFLINE kept
  producing numbers that did not transfer — an isolated LANCZOS bench read 553ms while the
  whole live shot was 603ms — and guessing which stage dominated is how ~46ms/grab of memcpy
  and a 264ms-per-shot subprocess both survived an entire optimization pass. First real
  breakdown of a 601ms monitor shot: `resize 408, encode 173, decode 19, aware 1` with `pull`
  under 1ms. Resize is 68% and the current top cost.

- **Awareness probe cached — it was spawning a Python subprocess on every screenshot.**
  `awareness.summary()` runs per shot. When the optional window-info extension isn't loaded
  it fell through to `atspi_titles()`, which spawns a fresh interpreter (measured 263.6ms)
  purely to render the text line "awareness: unavailable". Whether the extension is loaded
  only changes on a Wayland re-login or a `screen_reload`, so the negative verdict is now
  cached (`MCP_SCREEN_AWARENESS_TTL_S`, default 30s) rather than re-probed every frame.
  A plain monitor shot went 1084ms -> 603ms.

- **Two hidden 33MB copies removed from every grab.** `_sample_to_rgba` ran on every frame
  pull — including every poll of the settle and change-gate loops — and did `bytes(mi.data)`
  (a full memcpy of the mapped 4K frame, 9.7ms) followed by `arr[..., [2,1,0,3]]` (a fancy-index
  allocation to swap BGRx→RGBA, 36.7ms). `mi.data` is already a buffer, so `np.frombuffer`
  wraps it as a view for free; and the pipeline now negotiates **RGBA** directly, so
  videoconvert does the channel order in C and there is nothing left to swap. The old
  "BGRx on the wire for speed" comment was backwards once the cost landed in numpy. ~46ms
  saved per grab; a plain monitor shot went 1286ms → 1084ms, and the poll loops that grab
  5–9 times per action save proportionally more. Colors verified live after the caps change.

  The copy must be `.copy()`, not `ascontiguousarray`: with RGBA the trimmed view is already
  contiguous, so `ascontiguousarray` returned it unchanged — leaving the array aliasing the
  buffer after `unmap` (use-after-free) and read-only, which killed the alpha write with
  "assignment destination is read-only" on the first live grab.

  Still open, measured but not wired: a region shot converts the whole frame then discards
  ~95% of it, which is why a 1500x130 region can cost *more* than a full-monitor grab
  (87.9ms vs 3.9ms cropping first). Cropping in `_sample_to_rgba` would make `_note_frame`'s
  per-monitor freshness signature region-scoped, so it needs its own path.

- **`screen_drag` takes `modifiers`, held for the whole press-move-release.** Without it,
  `screen_read_selection` could not be used where it matters most: a terminal running a TUI
  (Claude Code, vim, htop) enables mouse tracking and consumes the drag itself, so no
  terminal-level selection is ever made and the copy returns nothing. `modifiers: ["shift"]`
  makes the terminal emulator bypass the app's mouse grab and select on its own. Verified
  live end-to-end — shift+drag over a TUI pane then `ctrl+shift+c` returned the line
  verbatim, box-drawing glyphs, em-dash and spacing intact, matching the pixels on screen.
  Modifiers press inside the same device lock as the drag and release in a `finally` on both
  the uinput and portal paths, because a stuck Shift would corrupt every later keystroke.

- **New `screen_read_selection` — read text exactly, without OCR.** Copies the focused
  window's selection and returns it verbatim. An OCR-based read of a full 4K monitor
  loses ~8% of characters on sub-12px code (measured against known rendered text across
  a font-size sweep — an artifact of the 4K→2576 downscale, not of the filter: LANCZOS
  beat box/bilinear/nearest at every size and stays the default). The clipboard is
  **cleared before** the copy combo is sent: without that, an app that ignores the combo
  leaves the prior clipboard in place and the tool would return the user's unrelated
  clipboard contents labelled as screen-read text. The user's clipboard is saved and
  restored regardless. Terminals need `combo='ctrl+shift+c'`.

- **Post-action change-gate can wait on damage events instead of polling.**
  `MCP_SCREEN_WAIT_MODE=poll|event|hybrid` (default `poll`, byte-identical to before).
  Damage arrives every ~270–550 ms on an active desktop while the gate polls every 60 ms,
  so most poll iterations grab and convert a 4K frame to learn nothing. `hybrid` blocks on
  a real damage event with the poll interval kept as a backstop, so an absent event
  degrades to today's behavior rather than stalling. `screen_diag` now reports damage
  cadence, keepalive-resend counts and wake stats under `cursor.events`.

- **Focus verification — root-cause fix for clicks landing on the wrong window/tab.**
  `screen_focus`/`focus=` no longer report success without confirming the correct
  window actually got raised: both the window-info-extension path (`activate_window`)
  and the no-extension GNOME Overview fallback (`activate_via_overview`) now check
  `awareness.focused_window()` before claiming success, instead of trusting a bare
  boolean or "the keystrokes were sent." Any real focus/activation attempt now also
  marks the current view stale — `resolve_xy` raises a new `FocusDriftError`
  (a `StaleViewError` subclass) rather than silently clicking screenshot coordinates
  that may no longer match what's on top, until a fresh screenshot is taken.
  `_action`, `screen_do`, and `screen_tour` now all check and act on a focus
  failure instead of discarding it (`screen_tour` previously never applied
  per-step `focus` at all — a complete no-op).
- Element-id staleness guard: `element=<id>` (from an annotated screenshot) now
  raises the same class of stale error when a later screenshot has superseded the
  cached elements, instead of silently resolving to a renumbered/wrong element.
- `verify=true` on `screen_key`/`screen_type` now actually performs a whole-frame
  diff instead of silently no-op'ing — it previously only worked for
  coordinate-bearing tools (click/scroll/drag).
- uinput's fractional-scale miscalibration warning now surfaces into
  `screen_click`/`move`/`scroll`/`drag`'s own returned text instead of sitting
  only in an internal log file the caller never reads.
- Removed `reliability.wrap_call` — fully dead code (zero call sites); its
  ack-gate/hash/diff primitives are already composed directly by server.py's
  `_action`/`_verify`.
- 8 new regression tests (`tests/test_input.py`) covering the above.
- **`screen_watch` — human-eye 1 fps observation (default confirm for thrashy UIs).**
  Samples a region/monitor at `fps` (default 1) for `seconds` (default 6) and
  returns `settled | evolving | jitter | unstable`. Sustained local motion
  without navigation → `jitter` (the "looks crazy" case: force-directed graphs,
  canvas thrash). Drive-screen skill + server `instructions` + docs now make
  watch the default confirm path after graphs/maps/canvases/loaders — a single
  screenshot is a glance, not a visual QA pass.
- Unit tests: `tests/test_watch.py` for verdict classification.
- **`screen_sense` + `sense.to_pixel_signal()` — the pixel half of cross-layer
  verification.** Normalizes the rich SENSE dict into the compact
  `{changed, opened, modal, no_op, activity}` contract and exposes it as a
  read-only tool, so an agent can hand the `pixel` object to os-control-mcp's
  `os_verify` and catch a GUI that changed while the underlying service did not.
  7 new `to_pixel_signal` unit tests.

- 88plug compliance: dual Grok install on docs/install; MkDocs-relative doc links
  (drop 404 `blob/main/*.md` paths); Manual MCP docs use `bin/screen-mcp` (T1
  launcher, not bare python3); document CI Python 3.12 pin (rapidocr wheels);
  unknown-tool `tools/call` returns MCP `isError` result; ruff format clean.

- Fixed the takeover guard false-firing forever on a STATIC monitor: `cursor_pos(prefer_node=...)`
  pins to a per-node cursor sample that never refreshes once a monitor stops repainting, so
  `guard_user` compared every subsequent commanded click against ONE frozen point and raised
  `UserControlError` with the IDENTICAL "live" position every time — also blocking the
  `_nudge_prime` frame-refresh path that would have fixed it (it calls `guard_user()` too).
  Added `capture.cursor_sample_age()` and a `MCP_SCREEN_GUARD_STALE_S` (default 3.0s) cutoff:
  a sample older than that is treated as "can't be read" and fails open, same as today's
  existing no-cursor fail-open path.

- `prereqs` matrix in `screen_diag` + `setup.sh` bootstrap (status + `next_step` per dependency).
- `awareness.extension_state()` — distinguish window-info installed-but-not-loaded vs not installed.
- `server.__version__` derives rolling calver (matches hub); guard test keeps `plugin.json` version-less.

## 2026.6.23

- Initial release: MCP server that gives a model eyes and hands on a Linux
  Wayland desktop — screenshot any monitor and click, type, scroll, drag, and
  read any visible app over xdg-desktop-portal (RemoteDesktop + ScreenCast),
  with optional OCR and OmniParser icon grounding. Ships the `drive-screen`
  skill that encodes the locate-ground-act-confirm loop.
