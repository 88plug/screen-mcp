"""autoloop.py — server-side self-adaptive micro-loops for mcp-screen (v1.2).

These are deterministic loops that need NO model in the loop, so any consuming CLI gets
them for free and they cost zero LLM round-trips.

- `scroll_to_reveal` — read a long page in one call (scroll until no new content).
- `watch_1fps` — human-eye observation: sample the screen at ~1 fps and report what
  a human would notice over time (settled UI vs continuous jitter / force-sim chaos /
  navigations). Default path after animations, canvases, graphs, maps, loaders.

Imports the sibling modules directly (capture/input/grounding/sense/state) — none import
this, so no cycle. Fail-open: errors degrade to whatever was gathered so far."""
