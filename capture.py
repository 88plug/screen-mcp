"""capture.py — PipeWire frame capture + desktop compositing for mcp-screen (v1.2).

Owns one PERSISTENT pipewiresrc->appsink pipeline per monitor node, kept in PLAYING
so each grab just pulls the latest negotiated frame (no per-call pipeline rebuild).
The single OpenPipeWireRemote fd from state.SESSION backs every pipewiresrc; each
pipewiresrc dup()s the fd internally so sharing is safe. RGBA is negotiated on the wire so
videoconvert does the channel order in C — the old BGRx-then-swap-in-numpy path cost a 33MB
fancy-index allocation (36.7ms) on every grab, including every settle/change-gate poll.
GStreamer 1.28: `drop=` is gone — we use `leaky-type=downstream` + max-buffers=1 to keep
only the freshest frame.

DAMAGE-DRIVEN STREAMING: GNOME/Mutter negotiates framerate 0/1 (send-on-damage), so a
monitor that is powered ON but STATIC (no cursor, no animation) produces NO buffer until
something on it changes. pipewiresrc's keepalive-time only re-sends an ALREADY-EXISTING
last buffer, and resend-last only fires on EOS — neither can bootstrap the FIRST frame of a
never-damaged source. There is no portal API to force a frame, so the only lever is to
generate a damage event; ensure_geo() nudges the pointer onto a static-but-ON monitor to
prime it (see _nudge_prime).

Imports state (session/portal plumbing). Does NOT open a portal session itself beyond
calling state.ensure_session() at runtime via ensure_geo()."""
