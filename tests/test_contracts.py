Each of these is a pure unit test — no desktop, no portal, milliseconds — and each one
would have caught a defect that instead escaped to production and was found later by an
adversarial review. They assert CONTRACTS (what the caller is promised), not that a
function returned without raising, which is the distinction that failed us.
