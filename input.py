"""input.py — pointer/keyboard injection for mcp-screen (v1.2).

Drives the xdg-desktop-portal RemoteDesktop session that `state` owns. All public
tool entry points (move/click/scroll/drag/key/type_text) resolve their coordinates to
global NATIVE composite pixels (the same space screenshots live in), map those to the
per-stream LOGICAL coordinate space PipeWire/the portal expect, and emit Notify* calls.

Coordinate mapping (the important part):
  NotifyPointerMotionAbsolute coords are in the *stream's* LOGICAL space, per-stream,
  keyed by node_id. Under fractional scaling the logical size = native size / scale.
  We therefore divide the in-monitor native offset by that monitor's scale and add the
  monitor's logical origin (lpx/lpy). This replaces the old native-px + relative-motion
  remainder hack entirely — no COORD_MODE, no NotifyPointerMotion fixup."""
