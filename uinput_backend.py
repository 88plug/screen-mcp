"""uinput_backend.py — kernel-level input injection for mcp-screen (v1.2).

WHY THIS EXISTS: the xdg-desktop-portal RemoteDesktop path injects pointer MOTION per
ScreenCast stream, and on a multi-monitor / damage-driven (static) setup that motion is
unreliable — absolute moves to an idle monitor get coalesced/dropped, so the positionless
button/axis that follow land at the wrong place. The fix the leading GNOME-Wayland tools
(agent-sh/computer-use-linux) use: a private uinput device exposing a TRUE absolute pointer
(ABS_X/ABS_Y) whose range equals the full native desktop. The compositor maps that range
across the whole logical layout, so writing ABS(x,y) makes the pointer JUMP to native pixel
(x,y) — exact, acceleration-free, scaling-free, monitor-state-independent. Clicks/scroll then
land where intended with no portal, no cursor-readback dependency.

Requires /dev/uinput writable (group `input`, udev rule) + python-evdev. If either is missing
this module reports unavailable and input.py falls back to the portal path. CPU-only, no GPU.
